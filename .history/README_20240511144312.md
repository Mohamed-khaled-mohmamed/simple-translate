## How to use it



<!-- 
## Funding URL

You can include funding URLs where people who use your plugin can financially support it.

The simple way is to set the `fundingUrl` field to your link in your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
    "fundingUrl": "https://buymeacoffee.com"
}
```

If you have multiple URLs, you can also do:

```json
{
    "fundingUrl": {
        // "Buy Me a Coffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com",
        // "GitHub Sponsor": "https://github.com/sponsors",
        // "Patreon": "https://www.patreon.com/"
    }
}
```
